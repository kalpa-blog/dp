Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number n on the chalkboard. On each players turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

Choosing any x with 0 < x < n and n % x == 0.
Replacing the number n on the chalkboard with n - x.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return true if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: false
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.

If N is even, can win.
If N is odd, will lose.

Recursive Prove (Top-down)

If N is even.
We can choose x = 1.
The opponent will get N - 1, which is a odd.
Reduce to the case odd and he will lose.

If N is odd,
2.1 If N = 1, lose directly.
2.2 We have to choose an odd x.
The opponent will get N - x, which is a even.
Reduce to the case even and he will win.
